    <h2>Resume</h2>

    <p>
      I recently graduated from a Web Development course at General Assembly
      where I increased my typing speed from 10 words per minute on my type
      writer to 100 words per minute on my new MacBook Pro. They also taught me
      how to be an <strong>awesome</strong> Web Developer. During my spare time,
      I enjoy senior water aerobics, pickling, and spending time with my great
      grand children.
