    <h1>Koalas</h1>
    <h2>The sleepiest of creatures.</h2>
    <p class="box1">
      The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus, or, inaccurately, koala bear) is an
      arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant
      representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living
      relatives are the wombats, which comprise the family Vombatidae.
    </p>

    <p class="box2">
      The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern
      regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South
      Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large
      head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a
      body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Pelage
      colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the
      northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than
      their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate
      subspecies, but this is disputed.

      Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these
      trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited
      nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up
      to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only
      between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud
      bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their
      presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being
      marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into
      their mothers' pouches, where they stay for the first six to seven months
      of their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned
      around a year old.

      Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by
      various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala
      retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.
